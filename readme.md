# PK Shootout :soccer:

PK Shootout is a 1-player penalty kick shootout game built mostly by using HTML Canvas and Javascript. The player must click one of four keys on their keyboard to pick a spot and shoot. Score at least 3 out of 5 goals, you win. The goal keeper is set up to randomly select a spot to dive towards for each shot.
